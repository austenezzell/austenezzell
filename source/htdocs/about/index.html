                <p>First off, I’m a designer who <a href="#" class="toggle-link no-smoothState" data-description="whyCode">codes</a>.</p>
                <div class="toggle-content" data-description="whyCode" style="display:none;">
                  <p>I code for several reasons; </p>

                    <div><p>I love making things. It’s the reason I became a designer in the first place. I grew up working in my dad’s studio, sculpting, painting and making whatever I could think of. Digital has become my preferred medium for creating. </p></div>
                    <div><p>It’s impossible to properly understand how to design something if you don’t understand the context in which it will be viewed. </p></div>
                    <div><p>Iteration is a huge part of my process. I iterate in both design and development. It’s the intersection of these areas where I feel the most freedom.</p></div>
                    <div><p>I make mistakes. It’s impossible to imagine all scenarios. User testing allows me to see where my designs are failing and I can go through the process again to find a solution.</p></div>
                  </div>
                </div>

                <p>I’m currently a Senior Interaction Designer / Developer at <a class="no-wrap toggle-link no-smoothState" data-description="work" href="#">Cinco Design</a>
                <span class="toggle-content" data-description="work"  style="display:none;"><a  class="employer" href="http://www.cincodesign.com">cincodesign.com</a></span>

                in Portland, Oregon. At Cinco, I am primarily focused on designing engaging products that make peoples lives easier and more enjoyable. My work alternates between product design and marketing, but I try to look at marketing sites in a similar way to how I would look at a <a class="toggle-link no-smoothState" data-description="marketingProduct" href="#"> product</a>. </p>

                <div class="toggle-content" data-description="marketingProduct"  style="display:none;">
                  <p>After several years working in Advertising I have come to the realization that advertising, as we have known it, is dead. People no longer consume information the way we used to, we expect to engage with brands and we demand utility. As a result, even marketing sites need to be looked at through the lens of the user with the goal of helping him or her achieve their goals. This philosophy should affect all touchpoint from IOT to mobile to desktop. We need to stop thinking in terms of device, and start thinking about user objectives and how different scenarios may affect those objectives. </p>
                </div>

                <p>I also work on several side projects, take photos, play soccer and walk the neighborhood with <a class="toggle-link no-smoothState" data-description="laurenMaggie" href="#">my wife and Newfoundland dog Maggie Mae.</a></p>
